# BLoC Pattern Rules

This project uses BLoC pattern for state management. See `flutter_clean_bloc.mdc` for complete implementation guidelines.

## Key BLoC Requirements
- Use BLoC for all state management
- Immutable states only (use `.freezed.dart` for code generation)
- Event-driven architecture
- Single source of truth per feature
- Pure event handlers (no side effects)
- Use code generation for states and events
