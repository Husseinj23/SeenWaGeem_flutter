# Clean Architecture Rules

This project follows Clean Architecture principles. See `flutter_clean_bloc.mdc` for complete implementation guidelines.

## Key Clean Architecture Requirements
- Three-layer architecture: Domain, Data, Presentation
- Dependencies point inward toward Domain
- Domain layer has no external dependencies
- Use interfaces/abstract classes for layer boundaries
- Repository pattern for data access
- Use case pattern for business logic
- Use `.freezed.dart` and `.g.dart` code generation when needed
